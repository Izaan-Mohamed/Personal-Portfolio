                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am a hardworking and community-oriented student with a passion for staying active and helping others. I wrestled for my school team for six years and played volleyball for two, both of which taught me perseverance, teamwork, and discipline. As a member of the National Honor Society, I’m committed to academic excellence and service. I volunteer regularly at local pet shelters and with an organization that helps newcomers to the country learn English—both experiences that have deepened my compassion and communication skills. In my free time, I enjoy being out in nature, going on scenic drives with friends, and traveling to new places whenever I can with family.</p>
